# Mocha-Compiler
A lexer/parser/compiler for a C like language, written in Java for an interpreted language written in C++ (still in the works)

This is an old project, one of my first attempts at a lexer/parser, it's not very clean because there's a lot of test code but it outputs op code just fine.

The opcode can be used executed in an interpreter that was written in c++ ( will upload later ).

I'm still working on this, I'll try to clean up the code as much as I can for people to be able to use it.
